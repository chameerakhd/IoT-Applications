# 📡 IoT Devices and Applications – Arduino Projects

Welcome to my project repository for the **IoT Devices and Applications** module. This repository documents weekly assignments involving hands-on work with **Arduino Uno**, circuits, sensors, and actuators. Each folder includes:
- ✅ Arduino code
- 🧠 Weekly notes & observations
- 🔌 Circuit diagrams
- 🖼️ Images / media
- 📁 TinkerCAD or Wokwi simulations (when available)

## 📅 Weekly Task Breakdown

### 🔹 Week 01
**Task 1: 8-Key Tone Generator**  
- Created a tone generator using 8 push buttons.
- Each button outputs a different frequency (300Hz to 1kHz).
- Multiple key presses result in summed frequency output.

**Task 2: Display Key Number on 7-Segment Display**  
- Integrated a 7-segment display to show the key number pressed.
- Alternates key numbers every 500ms if multiple keys are pressed.
